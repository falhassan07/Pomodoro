# Pomodoro Timer
A simple Pomodoro Timer application built with Python to help you manage your time effectively by implementing the Pomodoro Technique.

## About the Pomodoro Technique
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that encourages focused work sessions and regular breaks. Here's how it works:

1. Choose a task to work on.
2. Set a timer for 25 minutes (one Pomodoro session).
3. Work on the task until the timer rings.
4. Take a short 5-minute break.
5. After completing 4 Pomodoro sessions, take a longer 15-30 minute break.

This technique promotes productivity while reducing mental fatigue.

## Features
1. Configurable work and break durations.
2. Alerts when the session ends (sound or visual notifications).
3. Keeps track of completed Pomodoro sessions.
4. Simple and lightweight, runs on any Python environment.

## Installation
TBC

## Usage
1. Start the timer by running the script: python pomodoro.py
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to begin your Pomodoro session.
3. Customize the durations (work, short break, long break) in the script as needed.
4. At the end of each session, take your break and start the next one.
